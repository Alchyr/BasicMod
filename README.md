# Basic Mod

This is an empty Slay the Spire mod + a modding tutorial.

This tutorial will help with setup and the basics of Slay the Spire modding, but it will not teach you Java. If you know nothing of Java, you are strongly recommended to look up a free online course and do at least some of it. It is possible to do modding with almost no proper knowledge, but it will make things much more difficult.

## Know what you're doing?

You can still use this mod as a base, or you could use another template like https://github.com/DarkVexon/ProTemplate

You can find more options in the pins of the #modding-technical channel in the Slay the Spire discord server.
